# Inductor-Design-Using-Neural-Network
**_Need Heavy Editing_**
_**ABSTRACT:** Due to evolution of the modern industry, systems are becoming more complex, and hence engineering design process has become a complex task, and hence the idea of a design assistant that can predict design variables based on knowledge base is required. In the given report, the documentation of the design project for the development of the C-core Inductor is presented which is based on the knowledge base. Our team goal was to design the Neural Network (NN) which can give the dimensions and other important parameters for the Inductor Design, according to the user requirements. The inputs and outputs of the NN are kept fixed, and the inputs to the NN will be from JESS system, and output of the NN which are the dimensions and other important parameters of the design is returned to the JESS for the constraint and the user satisfaction._
